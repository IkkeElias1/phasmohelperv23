        <h2>Haunted Mirror</h2>
        <p>The mirror must be toggled while inside. When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the ghost room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. <br/>
            If the users' sanity reaches zero, the mirror will break and start a cursed hunt near the users' position. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="disabled">
        <h2>Music Box</h2>
        <p>A music box can be activated by holding it in the hand and using the secondary use key to activate the device. The music box can only be used once.<br/>
            The music box will make the ghost sing along while being invisible, broadcasting its location. If the music box is 5 meters or less from the ghost, it will appear and start walking towards the box. If the ghost touches it, walks for more than 5 seconds, or the player drops the box while the tune is playing, it will start a cursed hunt. The music box can be handheld or put on the floor, the latter being the only safe way to discard the box without triggering a cursed hunt while it's playing.<br/>
            The sanity will drop only if the player can hear the song.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="disabled">
        <h2>Ouija Board</h2>
        <p>Once activated, the planchette will appear, cancelling the setup phase if it is ongoing.<br/>
            The player asking the question must have the Ouija Board inside the investigation area, as well as be inside to ask questions.<br/>
            The Ouija Board does not have to be in the Ghost Room (nor the ghost's current room) to respond.<br/>
            To deactivate the Ouija Board, the player must say "Goodbye", which will make the planchette disappear.<br/>
            If the player who activated the board walks away from an active Ouija Board, or has insufficient sanity to "pay" for the question that they ask, the board will break itself up and trigger a cursed hunt.<br/>

        <p>If the question is recognised, the planchette will move to answer the question, and an EMF Level 2 reading will be generated around the Ouija Board.<br/>
            If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as evidence, there is a 25% chance for this to be the reading instead.<br/>
            The response chance is not affected by whether or not the ghost is shy.</p>

        <h2>Summoning Circle</h2>
        <p>The summoning circle can be used by lighting all five red candles with a lighter.<br/>
            Each candle deducts 16% sanity, leading to a total of 80% sanity being deducted for all candles.<br/>
            Once all five candles are lit, the ghost will be summoned and fully-materialized, and stay motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. <br/>
            After the 5 second "grace period", it will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot. Once the summoning circle has been activated, it cannot be used again.<br/><br/>

            If the circle is lit while a hunt is already ongoing, the ghost will be teleported to the middle of the circle, and the hunt will continue. </p>

        <h2>Tarot Cards</h2>
        <p>Each Tarot cards deck contains 10 randomly generated cards. There are various possible cards the player can draw from the deck, each having a unique effect on either the player or the ghost if it is nearby. After being used, each card will vanish in a colored flame that is dependent on its type. The cards must be drawn inside the investigation area for them to work.<br/><br/>
            There are 10 possible cards that can be drawn. A single card type can appear more than once in the deck, and there are different percentages for each card to spawn.<br/>

        <h2>Voodoo Doll</h2>
        <p>Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random.<br/>
            This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the player's sanity by 5%. If the heart pin is pressed down, it will instead initiate a cursed hunt and drop the player's sanity by 10%.<br/>
            If the player's sanity is less than what the pressed pin would drain, all of the remaining pins will get pushed in and a cursed hunt will occur. </p>

    <div class="disabled">
        <h2>Monkey Paw</h2>
